The project's primary objective was to develop an engaging and simple app platform for enhancing women's cosmetics purchasing experiences and access to inexpensive cosmetics.
## Usage

In my app you I have included a like button '♥' that can be clicked several times . This "like" button also places the item in your shopping cart. As so long as you continue to like a product, you can add multiple quantities of it.

 ## Hidden Feautures

If you hover your mouse over any product makeup image, a complete product description will appear. The display will be hidden as you move your cursor away from the product image.
